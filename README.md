# aerospike-contour-generator
The **Aerospike Contour Generator** is a MATLAB-based tool that provides a user-friendly interface and powerful functions and scripts to generate contour profiles for aerospike nozzles, using isentropic relations. This script literally eliminates the need to calculate each and every x and y coordinate of the aerospike nozzle profile manually and automates everything for the user.

**NOTE:** This MATLAB Sciprt only generates the Contour Profile based on Isentropic Relations.

# **Parameter Calculation:** 
The script calculates essential parameters such as exit Mach number, area ratio, Prandtl-Meyer angle, and flow turn angle using user-specified inputs.

# **Contour Generation:**
The script generates contour profiles for aerospike nozzles based on the calculated parameters. It provides both dimensional and non-dimensional coordinates for the contour, allowing users to visualize and analyze the shape and characteristics of the aerospike nozzle. The number of x and y coordinates can be specified in the script according to your requirement.

# **Output Formats:** 
The generated contour coordinates will be saved in a CSV file, which can be directly imported into popular CAD software like AutoCAD, fusion 360 for further visualization and 3D modelling.

# **Advanced Calculations:** 
The script also includes the necessary functions to convert between Mach numbers, Prandtl-Meyer angles, and area ratios. If someone needs these functions for their own script, they can just simply use it without further modifications.
